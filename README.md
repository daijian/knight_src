mlp algorithm with tensorflow
The step to run the source code.
1. Use the Linux shell command *cat* to concatenate all the files in the subdirectory into a file. Then copy them to one directory
2. Run **python preprocess.py** in the directory of step 1 to generate the only one data file named **complete_data.csv**
3. Run **python mlp_didi.py** in the same directory to test the algorithm
